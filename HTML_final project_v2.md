### [The overview of Korea ODA]

-	2010: Korea joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), which is a group of donor countries
-	2010~present : Korea has made various efforts to contribute to the international community through ODA  

The size or scale of Korea’s ODA has been more than doubled in ten years, while many advanced donors have reduced or have not increased that of their ODA due to difficult economic conditions. For example, the size of Korea’s ODA was about 1.2 billion dollars in 2010, when Korea joined DAC, but it has reached 2.5 billion dollars in 2019, while twelve donor countries including Spain, Greece, and Portugal among 29 members of OECD DAC have decreased their support of ODA during the same period (OECD DAC, 2020). Also, the Korean government has been working to drive a systematic and predictable ODA

- January, 2021 : Korean government newly selected 27 key ODA partners to be applied by 2025  

The number of key partners has increased slightly from 26 countries in 2010, 24 partners in 2015, to 27 partners this time
